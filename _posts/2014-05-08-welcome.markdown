Hi folks!

This is going to be a journal/reference of sorts for the various homebrewing and fermenting adventures here in sunny Singapore.

----

In the past two days, I have started:

-   A glutinous rice wine, following a post by my friend [Hong Yee](http://madhausbeer.blogspot.sg/2013/05/chinese-rice-wine.html);
-   A batch of kombucha, after being donated a SCOBY by a fellow homebrewer;
-   An Extra Strong Bitter;
-   A malted, slightly hopped cider.

I didn’t take any photos, but perhaps I’ll put some up as things progress. Cheers!
